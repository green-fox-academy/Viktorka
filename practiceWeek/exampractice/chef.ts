// - It should store information about the `meals` it ever cooked (name of the food + amount of times it was cooked)
// - Whenever it is instructed to `work`:
//   - It should increase its `experience` by `1`
// - It should have a `cook` behavior
//   - This should get the `name of the food` as an input
//   - This should update the `meals` information so we are able to track that it cooked this specific food again
