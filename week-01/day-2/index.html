        <h1>Persian Cat</h1>
        <p>The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی‎, romanized: Gorbe Īrānī) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized
            by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking
            countries. In the Middle East, region they are widely known as "Iranian cat" and in Iran they are known as
            "Shirazi cat". The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Iran
            (historically known as Persia in the west) around 1620.[1][better source needed] Recognized by the cat fancy
            since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American breeders
            after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic
            Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.</p>

        <h1>Russian Blue</h1>
        <p>The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a darker,
            slate grey. They develop close bonds with their owners and are sought out as pets due to their
            personalities, beauty and coat. It is their short, dense coat which has been the hallmark of the Russian
            breed for more than a century. The dense coat stands out from the body and one can draw patterns in the coat
            that will stay until one smoothes them out again.</p>

        <h1>Scottish Fold</h1>
        <p>The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant-gene mutation that affects cartilage
            throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the head,
            which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.[1]</p>
